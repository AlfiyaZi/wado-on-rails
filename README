The WADO standard specifies a Web-based service for serving up DICOM objects, such as images and or reports. WADO is intended for distribution of results and images to healthcare professionals.

DCM4CHE, a self titled Open Source Clinical Image and Object Management System, serves up images via WADO that exist in the DICOM archive.

RAILS, is an extensible web framework built on the Ruby Programming Language.

Bring these three together to create "wado-on-rails" and you have a simple search mechanism powered by Ferret, that accesses the dcm4che database, then lights up the related images for the patient with the ever popular lightbox2.

wado-on-rails is an academic work that was originally intended to compete with XERO, but now has seen some time and experimentation for image review on silly gadgets like Apple's iPhone.
